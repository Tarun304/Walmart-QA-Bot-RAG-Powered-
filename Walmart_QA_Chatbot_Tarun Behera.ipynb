It has a unique combination of atmospheric composition, temperature range, and water availability that make it habitable.\n4. **Mars**: Known as the \"Red Planet\" due to the iron oxide on its surface, Mars has a thin atmosphere and a surface that is mostly covered with craters and volcanoes. It is also home to two polar ice caps and evidence suggests that it may once have had liquid water on its surface.\n5. **Jupiter**: The largest planet in our solar system, Jupiter is a gas giant composed mostly of hydrogen and helium.
